# Using Vale with Commercial Docs tools

## MadCap Flare

[Flare](https://www.madcapsoftware.com/products/flare) has a [plugin architecture](http://help.madcapsoftware.com/flare2019r2/Content/Flare/Plug-In-API/Plugin-API.htm). We are investigating the possiblity of adding a Vale plugin to Flare, and welcome any contributions from our community who have any experience creating DLLs for Flare.

In the meantime, you can use Vale to check your Flare content by [enabling HTML and XML format support](markup.md#formats) and running Vale from the command line or in another supported text editor.
