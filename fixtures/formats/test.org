** Introduction

NOTE: This is a very interesting file.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
def foo():
    """
    NOTE: this is a very important function.
    """
    obviously = False
    very = True
    return very and obviously
#+END_SRC

As you can see, ~NOTE = True~. Here is another interesting codeblock:

*NOTE* another /XXX/ XXX

\(XXX\) another $XXX + XXX$

#+BEGIN_LATEX
\begin{maxima}
f: x/(x^3-3*x+2),     /* Integrating it */
tex('integrate(f,x)), /* will show its integral... */
print("="), XXX
tex(integrate(f,x)),  /* ...and the result */
print("+K")
\end{maxima}
#+END_LATEX
