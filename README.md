Vale is a natural language linter that supports plain text, markup (Markdown, reStructuredText, AsciiDoc, and HTML), and source code comments. Vale doesn't attempt to offer a one-size-fits-all collection of rules&mdash;instead, it strives to make customization as easy as possible.

Check out [project website](https://valelint.github.io/docs/) to learn more!

## Highlights

- [X] Supports Markdown, reStructuredText, AsciiDoc, HTML, and source code.
- [X] Extensible through straightforward YAML files.
- [X] Standalone binaries for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- [X] Expressive, [EditorConfig-like](http://editorconfig.org/) configuration.

## Features

Vale's functionality is split into extension points (called "checks") that can be customized to perform many different kinds of tasks, including finding [insensitive words and phrases](https://github.com/ValeLint/vale/blob/master/rule/GenderBias.yml), measuring [sentence length](https://github.com/ValeLint/vale/blob/master/styles/jQuery/SentenceLength.yml), enforcing a particular [heading style](https://github.com/ValeLint/vale/blob/master/styles/18F/Titles.yml), and identifying [undefined acronyms](https://github.com/ValeLint/vale/blob/master/styles/TheEconomist/UnexpandedAcronyms.yml). See the [Style Showcase](https://valelint.github.io/docs/showcase/) for more advanced examples.

Additionally, since Vale is "syntax aware," you'll never have to worry about syntax-related false positives (e.g., URLs or code blocks). See [Creating a style](https://valelint.github.io/docs/styles/#creating-a-style) for more information.

## Installation

There are a few options to choose from:

- [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) or [Linuxbrew](http://linuxbrew.sh/):

    ```bash
    $ brew tap ValeLint/vale
    $ brew install vale
    ```
- A Windows Installer package (`.msi`), which you'll find on the [releases page](https://github.com/valelint/vale/releases).
- Manually on **Windows**, **macOS**, or **Linux** by downloading an executable from the [releases page](https://github.com/valelint/vale/releases).

## Usage

Run Vale on a single file:

```shell
$ vale README.md
```

Run Vale on files matching a particular glob:

```shell
# Only lint Markdown and reStructuredText
$ vale --glob='*.{md,rst}' directory
```

Or exclude files matching a particular glob:

```shell
# Ignore all `.txt` files
$ vale --glob='!*.txt' directory
```

Pipe input to Vale:

```shell
$ echo 'this is some very interesting text' | vale
```

Run Vale on text with an assigned syntax:

```shell
$ vale --ext=.md 'this is some `very` interesting text'
```

See `vale --help` and [Configuration](https://valelint.github.io/docs/config/) for more information.

To use one of these styles, you'd copy its files onto your `StylesPath` and then specify it in your config file:

```ini
# This goes in a file named either `.vale` or `_vale`.

StylesPath = path/to/some/directory
MinAlertLevel = warning # suggestion, warning or error

[*.{md,txt}] # Only Markdown and .txt files
# List of styles to load
BasedOnStyles = vale, Joblint
# Style.Rule = {YES, NO, suggestion, warning, error} to
# enable/disable a rule or change its level.
vale.Editorializing = NO
```
